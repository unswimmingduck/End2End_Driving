# End-to-End self-driving
&emsp;&emsp;In this project, I used Pytorch to achieve end-to-end self-driving. I use gym-donkey to achieve self-driving based on OpenCV and generate dataset. Then, I used those data to successfully train the model and successfully acommplish self-driving in gym.

## 1. Introduction
&emsp;&emsp; In this project, based on the paper "End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars", I successfully accomplish self-driving in the Gym.
